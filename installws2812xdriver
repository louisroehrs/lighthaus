# The package sources are updated:
# credits to  https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x
sudo apt-get update
# We install the required packages (confirm with Y):
sudo apt-get install gcc make build-essential python-dev git scons swig
# The audio output must be deactivated. For this we edit the file
# Here we add the following line:
sudo echo 'blacklist snd_bcm2835' | cat >> /etc/modprobe.d/snd-blacklist.conf

We also need to edit the configuration file:
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
Below are lines with the following content (with Ctrl + W you can search):
# Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
dtparam=audio=on
This bottom line is commented out with a hashtag # at the beginning of the line: #dtparam=audio=on
We restart the system
sudo reboot
 
Now we can download the library.
git clone https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x
In this directory are on the one hand some C files included, which can be easily compiled. The example code for this is easy to understand. In order to use them in Python, we need to compile them:
cd rpi_ws281x/
sudo scons
However, in this tutorial we are mainly interested in the Python variant and therefore switch to the Python folder:
cd python
Here we carry out the installation:
sudo python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install
This will allow us to carry out a first test in the next step.
